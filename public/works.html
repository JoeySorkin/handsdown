      <h1>What <i>Hands Down</i> Does:</h1>
      <h2>Purpose:</h2>
      <p>
        A common way for sickness to enter your body is through hand to face
        contact. During the Coronavirus pandemic we are all trying our best to
        stay safe from getting sick, which usually includes staying at home.
        Unfortunately, some people still have to travel to their office, and
        even though their aren't a lot of people their they can still get sick
        from touching things. If your unwashed hands touch your face you are at
        high risk of getting infected. According to studies, people touch their
        face around 23 times per hour. Hands Down is an idea that attempts to
        reduce this number. It detects when you are going to touch your face and
        reminds you not to with an alert tone. Though it does not work close to
        perfectly, it still is an improvement from using nothing at all.
      </p>
      <h1>How <i>Hands Down</i> Works:</h1>
      <h2>Machine Learning:</h2>
      <p>
        Hands Down uses Google's TensorFlow library along with a specific model
        in order to predict when the user will touch their face. Essentially, a
        machine learning model is like blackbox. In this case, the input to the
        blackbox is images and the output decides what class the image best
        fits. When training this model, it would be given a group of images for
        each class. For example, the first class is called "normal". Normal is a
        set of images of people sitting at their desk, working without touching
        their face. For training, the model takes in around 70% of the images to
        be trained. It rewards itself when it predicts and image correctly and
        tweaks itself when it errs. The last 30% of images are used to test the
        accuracy of the model, similar to a final exam for an academic class.
        Unfortunately, the model was only trained with images of one person so
        it is not as powerful as it could have been. Once the model is trained
        and created, it gets integrated into the project through a
        <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/Ou_2Y3sHi/"
          >link to the teachable machine</a
        >. To use data from the model I call
        <code>prediction[i].probability</code> each <code>i</code> representing
        a class such as 'normal' or 'faceTouch'. This returns the models
        prediction of how likely it is to be a certain class. I use this data so
        that when a threshold (which is customizable in the Advanced View) is
        passed, a tone is played.

      <h2>Stack:</h2>
      <p>
        This project does not use a framework. It uses a couple libraries such
        as a loading bar library, TensorFlow, and firebase. Though there is no
        backend storage, Firebase was used to host the website. Firebase was
        chosen because it was free and easy to use. A github repo was not used
        throughout the whole project (which I regret), but you can view the
        finalized code at
